# How to add your own signature
Here at KOTH-Memekit, we're all about sharing the love. That's why if you want to add your own personal signature to the official binary, it's super easy!

It's just 4 easy steps:
1. Write a go file that performs your signature, it can be literally anything, I don't care!
2. Add that go file to the signatures folder titled `<username>.go`
3. In the main.go file, add your signature to the switch statement
4. Create a pull request and I'll most likely approve it!
(An example of the proper formatting can be seen via the "example" user)
